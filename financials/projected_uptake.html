<h1>Projected Uptake</h1>

<p>Now you need to decide to what is a more realistic income projection. What percentage of your <strong>Target Market</strong> do you think will actually buy the app? Remember, even if you build a great app, you can't expect <em>everybody</em> to buy it.</p>

<p>
  If you have no real idea about this, then 1% is a good starting place. This means that one in every hundred will buy the app.
</p>
  
<p>
  That might seem like a small figure but there are other aspects to consider too, such as: marketing (how many people in your <strong>Target Market</strong> will get to hear about your product) and competition (how many people will choose to buy a competing product before, or instead of buying yours).
</p>

<p>
  This number is called your <strong>Uptake Percentage</strong>.
