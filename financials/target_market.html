<h1>Target Market</h1>

<p>First you need to establish the realistic size of you market.</p>

<p>
  Start by taking the <strong>Market Size</strong> figure you previously calculated (from <strong>Intended audience</strong>) and try to determine how many of them actually use smartphones. For example, Star Trek fans are likely to keep up with <em>new</em> technology and the percentage may be high, while accountants may have gone down the traditional business route and all have Blackberrys. 
</p>

<p>
  Refine your initial <strong>Market Size</strong> figure down to what you now think is a realistic number. This is called your <strong>Target Market</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Your <strong>Target Market</strong> is the absolute <em>maximum</em> number of sales you would make if everyone you target bought the app.
