<h1>Benefits</h1>

<p>
  Benefits are the "buy now" decision makers for your audience.  When hearing or seeing the benefits, people will make a subconscious decision as to just how valuable that benefit will be to them. If the beneficial value is high enough, they will buy!

  <strong>Task: </strong>
  List all the features of the app and write a paragraph for each, explaining the benefit that the user will receive by using the app.<br>
  For example, "Password keychain: using the same password for lots of websites is very insecure. This app will let you store a different password for each website, but you'll only have to remember one; The app password!"
