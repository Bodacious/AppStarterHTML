<h1>Key Features</h1>

<p>
  The features are what makes the app special. They are usually unique, in that no other app does it, or does it in the same way yours does!
</p>

<p>
  The features are what will initially catch someone's attention and make them <em>want</em> to find out more.
</p>

<p>
  If your app's features are not leaping out at you after you write them down, it may be time to re-think!
</p>

<p class="task">
  <strong>Task: </strong> Write a list of all of your app's features and what they do. An example feature may be "A password keychain which lets you store passwords in a safe way".
