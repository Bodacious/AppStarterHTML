<p>So you have an idea for an app? <em>Terrific!</em></p>

<p>
 First of all, you need to structure and organise your thoughts so you can give a good, detailed, description of the app to other people for their assessment.
</p>

<p>
  You should start this process by putting your thoughts in writing and telling the reader:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>What the app is all about and a quick overview of what it will do</li>
  <li>What the key features are, and why they are so great</li>
  <li>What the main benefits are, and why they are so important to the user</li>
  <li>What the screens will look like</li>
</ul>
